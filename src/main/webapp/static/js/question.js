					I have tried doing it through the Firebase Nest SDK, \n \
					and the NestAPI.CompletionListener doesn 't get called at all. Seeing how that doesn' \
					t work,\n \
					I tried it with the REST api,  \
					where it worked twice, \
					and then again 1 in 30 tries.I also tried it with curl from the command line, \n \
					with the same results, \n \
					until I \
					finally got \"blocked\"  \
					because of the rate limiting.Before being blocked, \
					requests were returning the full thermostat object,\
					just like doing a GET request instead of PUT.\
					When the temperature actually didget updated,\n \
					the response contained just the new target_temperature_high_c and target_temperature_high_c values.\n \
					Has anyone else seen similar behavior ?\n \
